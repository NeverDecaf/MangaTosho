Hi, this is silverado. I've listed all hotkeys used in the default setting.
Of course you can change the hotkeys in MangaMeeya's menu (Tools->Customize). 
I've made two settings. Setting#1 is used with a keyboard and Setting#2
for wireless input devices like powerpoint presenters.

MangaMeeya Settings#1 (Default Setting, reload the setting by pressing F1)

#Reading:

Go to FIRST Page		HOME // on some keyboard this is known as 'POS 1')

Scroll Right		-> (Arrow right)
Scroll Left			<- (Arrow left)

#File Navigation:

MangaMeeya Setting#2 (Load the setting by pressing F2)

If you have one of those wireless presenters
like Logitech Cordless Presenter 2.4 (Bluetooth)
using Setting#2 will enable you to read your favourite manga
while leaning back in your chair. It starts automatically in fullscreen mode
using 1p layout.

Next Page			PAGEDOWN
Back				PAGEUP
Exit				DOT (.)
Remaining keys are similiar to Setting#1
