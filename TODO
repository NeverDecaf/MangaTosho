this is going to be very long and disorganized (for now, and maybe forever)
(most of these things are probably already implemented/fixed or irrelevant.)



maybe add an option to the context menu for renaming


what happens if two series have the same name? we need to handle this somehow:
	each series will have a unique url, but how will we know of conflicting names?
	this problem is actually really hard to solve
	perhaps:
		when adding a new series, check (in sql) for a name conflict. (What about testname and testname/, they don't conflict but the folder names do) (This is a real issue due to sequels)
											(ok just store the folder name in the sql, shouldn't be hard to do)
		if a conflict is found simply add a _2 to the name or something similar

decrease the timeout time.

store parsers externally so they can be updated

ignore updates on series with error type 3? (because it will never succeed)

add a window title, maybe an icon for the taskbar

Maintain a secondary sort order 
when a series is updated (e.g. doubleclick) it isn't sorted correctly due to the above
WHY? why will they not sort correctly after reading?
after reading it just gets pushed to the very top of unread:0 rather than sorted alphabetically

change window initial size

unread is more like undownloaded, fix that

save window maximized state when closed? doesnt seem possible

maybe quit out after one error?
to keep it from hanging on an update with many chapters that will all error. - should be implemented already




======================================


you should add this feature:
in the right click menu for a series, have an option "Find Alternatives"
this will perform a google search (not site specific)
and find results that align with valid parsers.
the user can then choose one to change the series over.


You might also want to throttle down the update checking frequency.
as of now I think it checks every series once per hour
in reality you only need to check like once a day, or even per week if its on a schedule
- this might already be done.


THERE SHOULD BE A LEGEND FOR THE COLORS (green red purple) (under help)
heres the legend for you since even you keep forgetting:
blue = normal, darkens as time passes without a new chapter
red = parser error. most likely means an update is needed.
green = other error. most likely a 404'd image or something of the sort. may need to increment chapter number manually if isn't resolved.
purple = liscensed. switch to another site.
gray = complete 


you should add a different, very visible, color (purple?) for errors due to 404'd images (NOT ELSEWHERE)
an alternative would be to allow 1 missing image per chapter, not the best for the reader but might save a lot of series from stalling out on this.




THINGS YOU NEED TO ADD:
a way to view/maybe edit the url for a series.
a way to sort by error type
a way to sort/view the last update date
that thing above about skipping one 404'd image per chapter???



============================================

-add legend

-separate parser into multiple files for ez update/additions.
make a new dir for this.
exe should look for outer dir first before falling back on bundled ones.

tooltip error on mouseover


add feature to strip off chapter when adding and passing a url that contains the chapter instead of the base series.


THIS FEATURE NEEDS TO BE ADDED BEFORE YOU CAN RELEASE:
when a series errors out, you should be able to view the error.
whats most important is the type (parsererror, httperror(404), other)
without this its way too hard to find out what went wrong.

it should also include the exact chapter and file where the error occured.


HERE IS ANOTHER FEATURE YOU NEED:
if you try to add a series that already exists (ie the same title) warn the user.
i have several dupes that have caused who knows what problems.
same url is one thing but same series from different sites is a whole other problem
you should also verify you have the _2 thing working correctly, it probably is because its ez to implement
in this case you can prompt the user to create _2 or cancel the add.



copy the url for a series from the context menu i guess or some other source (ctrl-c)



CONSIDER:
sorting the chapters after parsing them all from a page.
youve had occurances where specials appear afterwards and ruin the order.
example: 90 chapter series, special 9.5 added, latest chapter displayed as 9.5 despite having over 90 chapters.
can't really think of a downside to doing this as theyll be sorted when read by mmce regardless.
also stuff like fitnumber, etc. is never even used anymore as all chapter MUST be numbers now.

btw you still havent dealth with the series that have vols.
v1 c1-5 then v2 ch 1-5 
only the first ones will actually be downloaded the others just get ignored.
there are a couple ways to deal with this so pick one.
